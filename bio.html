        My name is Lamarana Diallo, but some call me "Diallo‚Äù. I‚Äôm originally from Senegal - a beautiful country l
        ocated in West Africa. I joined BMCC in the Fall 2017 after eight months of ESL classes at Hunter College 
        learning to write, read,  and speak English because I am from a French speaking country. 
        I am an international student and first generation college student, knowing this will give you an idea of how many challenges 
        I had to overcome to be a successful college student. But I did it,  I graduated from BMCC with honors in the Fall 2019 with an Associate in Science, major mathematics . I am currently attending John Jay college majoring in Computer science and information security, and double majoring in Applied Mathematics to data science. I am also part of the John Jay soccer team. 

Thanks to the Peer Mentoring Program and other BMCC students support services without which I would not have done it. I started with IMPACT as a mentee in my first semester at BMCC and it made a tremendous impact in my college life, experience,  and success. Having that mentor who speaks the same language as me, guiding me, connecting me to all BMCC services and opportunities made my college life joyful and successful. 

I joined the IMPACT program in the Fall 2027 as a mentee, then became a mentor in the following semester. I have been a mentor for several semesters and mentored dozens of students. I also served as Super peer (mentor to mentors). Now I am part of the Data team and still doing major to major Mentoring. 
<br>
Why a Mentor? <br>

Growing up, I‚Äôve always valued support and wisdom that came from those who have gone before me. Walking into a new place such as college can be frightening, so I was glad to have counselors and mentors to  help ease the fear and burden. Now that I am in the position to do the same for others, it brings great pleasure. 

Something I‚Äôve to Learn: <br>

Wow‚Ä¶where do I start? I have learned so much over the past years, but what comes to mind the most is  ‚ÄúNever be afraid to be better than you were  yesterday.‚Äù In life, we must strive each day to be better versions of ourselves because one can always make a difference

Fun fact about me is that I don't know if I am an introvert or extrovert. Maybe you'll help me figure it out. üòÜ <br>

The IMPACT Mentor is much like a family to me and I will be very happy to count mentors and mentees as part of that family as well. Joining the program has been one of the best life choices I‚Äôve ever made in college. I have learned so many things that have helped me grow academically, socially, and personally. 

As a servant leader, I‚Äôve had opportunities to give back to the BMCC community in many different ways. I have been President of the African Descent Club, a Member of the Student Government Association (SGA) as a senator for a year, a member of P.L.U.S, and a  math Supplemental Instruction (SI) Leader for the ASAP Program CUNY Tutor Corps math Tutor. I also served as a member of the Faculty and Student Disciplinary Committee for a year. I was also part of the soccer team and won CUNY Athlete Scholar of the year in 2019.

My native tongue is Fulani and French. I also speak and write other  languages such as French Wolof, other dialects in Africa and a little bit of Spanish. I love working hard but I also enjoy playing hard and having fun. Some of my hobbies include playing real life games such as jenga,  Uno, truth or dare... I  also love swimming, playing soccer. I also enjoy working out at the gym or running at the park or bicycling around the city. Helping people is one of my biggest passions. I am looking forward to getting  to know all you and I‚Äôm very excited to work with you this semester and all the upcoming ones. </p>
