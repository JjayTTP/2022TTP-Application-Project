Leandro Gamarra Portfolio Website
Welcome
My name is Leandro Gamarra and I am currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science/Information Security at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. I first transferred to John Jay on the Fall of 2020 from LaGuardia Community College. At LaGuardia I majored in Criminal Justice. I only recently got into the lucrative/amazing field that is Computer Science during the Spring of 2020. This is when I decided that I wanted to change my major and where I discovered my favorite programming language, Python. Ever since then, as you may have already seen in my LinkedIn or my Resume, I've completely immersed myself into this field. I've joined and became the President of the Computer Science Society Club at my college, I currently teach an iOS Development class to John Jay students in partnership with CodePath, taking plenty of outside CUNY courses like Ever-Up. Due to this, I've been able to help out plenty of students at John Jay, whilst also becoming a better person and programmer. That's a little about me
