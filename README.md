# Leandro Gamarra Portfolio Website

## Welcome

<p>
    My name is Leandro Gamarra and I am currently a Junior majoring in Computer Science/Information Security at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. I first transferred to John Jay on the Fall of 2020 from LaGuardia Community College. At LaGuardia I majored in Criminal Justice. I only recently got into the lucrative/amazing field that is Computer Science during the Spring of 2020. This is when I decided that I wanted to change my major and where I discovered my favorite programming language, Python. Ever since then, as you may have already seen in my <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/leandro-g-4689a3120/'>LinkedIn</a> or my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lNj8G-30FpHgWshAS7UnSOamjeJn_L3DmFBXUYpM4d8/edit?usp=sharing">Resume</a>, I've completely immersed myself into this field. I've joined and became the President of the Computer Science Society Club at my college, I currently teach an iOS Development class to John Jay students in partnership with CodePath, taking plenty of outside CUNY courses like Ever-Up. Due to this, I've been able to help out plenty of students at John Jay, whilst also becoming a better person and programmer. That's a little about me <br> You can find all my porfolio files below in their own respective folder. (TTP Website Application)
