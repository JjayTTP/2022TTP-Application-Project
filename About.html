                    Hi, my name is Israel Klein. Some of my common nicknames are Izzy or Izz.
                    I'm currently an upper sophomore at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. 
                    I'm majoring in Computer Science &amp; Information Security and minoring in
                    Law as well. I have a passion for tech, I love the challenge. Well, getting 
                    errors or the wrong output is never fun but that is part of the learning 
                    process, it is how we get better at what we do. I am only getting started
                    with this site I will keep improving it as I learn new features and techniques
                </p>
