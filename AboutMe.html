                    Throughout my college experience I have learned a lot about C++. <br />
                    I am also familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Over the summer <br />
                    I have earned a certificate in Systems Administration through the <br />
                    EverUP program and a Security+ certificate from CompTIA. <br />

                <p>
                    My main personal hobby is to play video games. <br />
                    I play a variety of games but I have two genres I enjoy most. <br />
                    The first is MOBAs since my favorite game is League of Legends. <br />
                    The second genre is puzzle games (I like the Ace Attorney Series) <br />
