		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<h2>Software Engineer/iOS Engineer</h2>
		<p style="color:black;">Queens, New York</p>
		<p style="color:black;">I came to the United States when I was five, after living in Peru for a few years. It took me about a year to fully learn English. I have my parents to thank for that. From the age of 5 until the age of 18 I played soccer at a competitive level. I used to travel to states throughout the Eastern coast, and the last championship I played was in Florida, where my team came second. It wasn't until the Summer of 2020 that I found my passion for Computer Science. Before this, I had never coded anything, but I was always on my computer when I wasn't playing soccer or video games. During this Summer, someone I looked up to got me into this fascinating field, which I then reesarched heavily, later making Python my main language. Since then, I transferred to John Jay in the Fall of 2020 and completely immersed myself into this field. </p>
		<p style="color:black;">But, to cut things short, now I enjoy making iOS Applications. I am currently working on a Crypto app using the SwiftUI Framework. Whenever I'm not studying for class or buildings apps, I do Leetcode problems to get better at technical interviews.</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/r0m3c/Movie-Library"><img src="images/movie.gif"></a>
			</div>
			<div class="s-b-text">
				<a href="#">Movie Library is an IOS application where a user can store any movie they want to watch in there app. Also, the user will have the options to look at what current movies are showing on theatres, and will have access to any reviews people may have written about the movie, and will see which actors were a part of the film.</a>

				<a href="https://github.com/r0m3c/Tweet"><img src="images/tweet.gif"></a>
			</div>
			<div class="s-b-text">
				<a href="#">Tweet is a an Twitter clone app, that I built through CodePath. In this app the user is able to sign in/out of Twitter, like tweets, see tweets of people they follow, and post a tweet. Lastly, the user is able to also refresh for new tweets and scroll indefinitely to load past tweets.</a>

				<a href="https://r0m3c.github.io/Project3.html"><img src="images/js.gif"></a>
			</div>
			<div class="s-b-text">
				<a href="#">In this project, I used HTML/CSS/Javascript to build a Guessing game. The user will be able to guess a number from 1-100. If they get the correct number, the screen will turn green and their updated highscord will be 10 now. Each user has 10 tries to get the correct number. Once the score reaches 0, the user loses.</a>
