        <span class="heading">You</span> <br><br>
        Life is a story, <br>
        If not for you, for me <br>
        Your life is a story <br>
         <br>
        A story I want to live and see <br>
        A story where I want to be <br> 
        Live the moments, Feel the life <br> 
        Climb up the mountains, see the sunrise <br>
        <br>
        more dreams and imaginations <br>
        promises and procrastination <br>
        And live what I never could <br>
        Or live the life I never should <br>
        In my head,  in my diary <br>
        Because, Your are a story. <br><br>

        Dear Dream <br>
        Please come when, <br>
        I am alone and asleep <br>
        And knock on a door to my soul <br>
        Take me to a beautiful ride <br>
        I the world where my mother reside <br><br>

    <div class="poem">
        <span class="heading" >Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening</span> <br> <br>
        Whose woods these are I think I know. <br>
        His house is in the village though;   <br>
        He will not see me stopping here   <br>
        To watch his woods fill up with snow.  <br><br> 
        
        My little horse must think it queer   <br>
        To stop without a farmhouse near   <br>
        Between the woods and frozen lake   <br>
        The darkest evening of the year.   <br><br>
        
        He gives his harness bells a shake   <br>
        To ask if there is some mistake.   <br>
        The only other sound’s the sweep   <br>
        Of easy wind and downy flake.   <br><br>
        
        The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   <br>
        But I have promises to keep,   <br>
        And miles to go before I sleep,   <br>
        And miles to go before I sleep. <br> <br>
