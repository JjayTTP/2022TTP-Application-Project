            </div>
             <p>I'm Christopher Thorne, an undergraduate computer science and information security student at John Jay college with a focus on full stack development and internet security. In my free time I like to play video games, pet my dogs and cats excessively, and learn new languages. My preferred mode of transportation is via longboard or rollerblades because my cat ate my license. I love learning new things, and I'm always looking to improve my skills. As I move forward into the future, I would like to sharpen my skills in database management, cybersecurity, and fullstack development. </p>
