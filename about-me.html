                    <blockquote>Hi there! Since you've reached this page, I have an inkling you're here to learn more about me. Going through this website, you probably wouldn't think I'm a computer science major. In fact, computer science is a second bachelor's degree that I'm pursuing. You can guess what my first degree is, but I bet you won't be able to unless you've cheated and snuck a peak at my LinkedIn page. Well, since it's on there, I might as well come clean and admit it -- I obtained my first bachelor's degree in Asian and Asian American studies at Stony Brook University. You may ask, what brings you to John Jay and the computer science department? Honestly, there are things in life that happened that no one can really plan for. These past two years, 2019 and 2020 (and even this current year) has been a rollercoaster for many. I never expected to work in the medical field after graduating, and I never could imagine working through the pandemic and surviving it, but here I am. These past years have made realize that life is short, really short, and it can go by in a blink of an eye. It's made me become adventurous, to take on more challenges and that lead me to...well, here! It's been a tough road, but it's been fulfilling all throughout it. I hope there is more fun to come as more challenges are placed my way, and I wish you all the best on all your future endeavors!</blockquote>
