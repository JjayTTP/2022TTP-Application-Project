	Donald Trump Birthplace - (Jamaica), New York
</h3>

<img src="trump.jpg" width="300" height="" alt=""/>

<p>Donald Trump was born at Jamaica Hospital, now known as Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. The photo above shows the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center campus. The building on the left labeled Trump Pavilion for Nursing and Rehabilitation was named after Donald Trump's mother Mary. The building on the far right is the hospital parking garage. <br> The presidentâ€™s former Jamaica Estates home was recently listed for sale, again. It may a good opportunity for someone who wants to Make Jamaica, Queens Great Again. The current owner requests a cash deal, which means only serious prospects need apply. And if the price or conditions scare you, consider the memorabilia perks tossed into the deal. The home was previously listed prior to his 2016 election for approximately $1.65 million.</p>
