Question: Given two stings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed from magazine and false otherwise.
Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

Psudo Code
1. assign ransomNote to a variable.
2.assign magazine to a variable. 
3.Create an empty dictionary that will store the frequency of letter in magazine.
4.if the array already have the letter from magazine already discard that and skip to another letter.
5.To do that we need to keep tack of the count of each letter in the array.
6.if all the letter in array from magazine can construct a world, return ture.
7.if not, return false.

In Python:

//store ransomeNote in ransom variable.
ransom = "ransomNote"
//store magazine in maga variable.
maga = "magazine"

//Create an empty dictionary to keep track on letter in maga
word_freq = {}

//loop all the letter in maga variable.
for i in maga:
    if i in word_freq:
    // if the letter is already in dictionary, increase the count for that letter.
        world_freq[i] += i
    else:
    //if the letter doesn't exit in dictionary, start count as 1.
        word_freq[i] = 1
