					About Me
					<p>
						<br>My name is Brian Velecela, I'm a transferred student from QueensBorough Commmunity College to John Jay College in approaching to achieve my bachelor's degree in computer science. What got me into this major was the interest of wanting to code. I would see these action movies, where they use their computer skills to hack in or use coding to save the world. From there, I was intrigued to how coding works with computers, how coding can controls over the computer. Another reason to why I picked computer science is because technology is growing, it's growing so rapidly to the point where any silly idea can significantly impact our future for the better.<br> 
						
						<br>On my free time, I like to go fishing, taking nature walks, and visting the ocean. All of these activities refreshes my mind and make me relax. On my remaining time I like to self teach myself other programming language like python, html and css. At this moment, I'm currently learning html and css. At first, I didn't know anything about html and css but after watching videos about it and doing mini project. I was able get the hang off it and start building this project. The thing I enjoy in web development is the amount of creativity needed to build a website. Although this is my ever first website created, I have more to learn in making this website better with my creativity.<br> <br>
